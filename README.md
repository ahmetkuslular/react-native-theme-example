## Inspiration
It's actually not that hard to style in RN projects. However, I do not like to make comparisons such as if it is dark in the component, take this color, and if it is light, take this color, and give a style in the component. That's why I always liked the styled-component logic. Passing the style a theme I created as a parameter always gives a cleaner result. and as a result such a package came out.
